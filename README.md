# Final-Project-Android-
The final project for the course Mobile Development 1 (Android). In this project, I wanted to make an application for calculating the cost of an order in a fictional cafe.

You can choose and add to the basket various dishes, salads, desserts, etc.

After that we can go to the shopping cart where we will see our order and the amount of the order.

At the end, we can delete the order by clicking on the "empty cart" button.
